## Context
The stub CLI is a minimal wrapper around clonedir_lib, but lacks production-ready features like error recovery and user feedback. This design addresses reliability and usability without overcomplicating the simple tool.

## Goals / Non-Goals
- Goals: Robust error handling, basic validation, improved UX
- Non-Goals: Advanced features like recursive options, GUI, or performance optimizations

## Decisions
- Use clap's error handling for argument validation
- Custom error enum for operation failures
- Optional verbose mode via env_logger or simple println

## Risks / Trade-offs
- Adding validation may slow startup slightly, but improves safety
- Verbose output increases complexity, but enhances debugging

## Migration Plan
No migration needed; enhancements are additive.

## Open Questions
- Should --force be default, or require explicit flag?
