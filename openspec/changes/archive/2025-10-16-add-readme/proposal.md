## Why
The project lacks user documentation, making it difficult for users to understand, install, and use the clonedir CLI tool.

## What Changes
- Add README.md to the project root with comprehensive documentation including description, features, installation, usage examples, and options.

## Impact
- Affected code: None (documentation only)
- Improves user experience and project discoverability
